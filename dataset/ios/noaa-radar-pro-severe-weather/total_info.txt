3.0******although i appreciate the alert to severe and dangerous weather in my area of residence , i can already envision my own demise due to no warn because i have turn off this apps alert capability because of how annoyingly frequent they be . i'm not talk about different weather alert or instance , but rather the same alert for the same instance with no update or change . i don't need to be tell that there be a freeze warn 4 time within less than 10 hour . i'd like to suggest make the alert option for pin area little more diverse . as it be now , you can turn them on or off . that's it . i'd like to be able to turn different type of weather alert on , and not see or hear about other type of weather occurrence as i do choose . for example , i'd appreciate know if a tornado be careen across the countryside toward my home . i'd turn that alert option on . but i don't want to be bother by freeze warn and flood watch . i'd leave those alert off . i'm sure in other area people would customize differently depend on the area they reside in . but have a choice as to what alert we want to be privy too make the app more enjoyable and far less obnoxious . maybe this be already a feature in the pay version , and i'm just waste my time here . but if not , i hope my suggestion make sense and be consider .******too annoy .******Oct 17, 2015******3.7******US

3.0******once again i allow myself to be dupe by all the stellar review of an app , only to be disappoint . grant , it be a well put together app . clean , straightforward , etc . it's strong point , if this be important to you , be allow you to see what just happen over the last 30 minute . yes , via the radar you can visualize exactly what pass over your house up to 30 minute ago . curiously , it offer zero ability to see where the cloud be head over the next , say , 30 60 minute , nor what be come your way . this be what's important to me . should i continue drive , or be there a cell head right into my path ? do i have time to mow the front yard before the rain get here ? etc . it seem to offer the ability to set alert , etc when something bad be come , but there be nothing unique about this . there be a dozen free apps that will do this . and besides , i can look out the window to see if something bad be come . in summary , it's baffle to me that this app have receive so many outstanding review . it's not a bad app by any mean , and in fact it seem to do what it do well enough . the issue be that it just doesn't do that much . at least i buy it on sale .******no futurecast radar ?******Apr 14, 2015******3.2******US
