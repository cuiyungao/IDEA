5.0******great keyboard with amaze auto correct . only gripe i have with it be type in thing like promo cod or gift card cod , it either try to correct it or autofills it with another previously use code that be obviously no longer valid . while i could disable auto correct when type such thing in it would be a pain to go into setting to disable it then go back in to enable it again after . it would be great to have a button to quickly disable it and enable it again when i be do right on the keyboard in the little swiftkey popup menu or better yet have the button disable it just for that use of the keyboard and automatically reset it to what i have it when the keyboard be close . just have this issue when type in a code in the xbox one smartglass app and it keep try to fill in the rest of the code with a code i use previously in the app for something else .******2015-01-07******5.1.2.75

4.0******still learn thing about this keyboard , but i m like what i m see . i m come from blackberry 10 , so the default android keyboard be n't very impressive . swiftkey make me raise my eyebrow ! only thing that could possibly make this keyboard better be a downward or forward swipe gesture to bring up special character , select the character , and automatically return to the regular keyboard . it be , honestly , the only thing about blackberry s keyboard that i m miss . customization be awesome !******2015-01-07******5.1.2.75
4.0******this be a great application that i really ca n't live without . it learn the way you type very well . however it would be nice to be able to add word that be not in the app so that it do not correct them as i have to keep use the same word fully until it learn that i use the word . only problem be that the response time be average and not the best .******2015-01-07******5.1.2.75
3.0******it should capitalize thing like i , and thing like name and obvious place , and it only add punctuation to thing if you use the swype thing . and the space after a period should only happen if you start another word , not automatically .******2015-01-07******5.1.2.75

2.0******i absolutely love swiftkey until i update it . now the autocorrects be ridiculous and it s faster just to type everything out . it keep give google , twitter , facebook and youtube as the top type suggestion . it have very weak autocorrect and even autocorrects word that be entirely correct . my phone s old , native keyboard be much more advance . it take me about 10 minute to type this , it use to take two or less .******2015-01-04******5.1.2.75

4.0******please , please , please change this . i think the exclamation , and question mark should have their own long press key . it would be far easier be able to long press , like you do with less use symbol . have to long press and slide to select a question mark , take longer , and be more fiddly , than select an asterisk . if you type a non dictionary word and press the character keyboard key , it default to auto correction . it s infuriate . it s so daft havin to do more to access more commonly use symbol .******2015-01-02******5.1.2.75

2.0******i try swiftkey and primarily use swiftkey flow . which be terrible in predict word , both learn and basic one in comparison to swype . not only be the prediction atrocious , but if you want to add a new word that have a number or symbol in it , you wo n't be able to because it s not an option with swiftkey . sure swiftkey have some great feature swype do n't have like theme ugly btw , number row futile , you can adjust long press delay on swype and be just as good , emojis not that important , different keyboard size good , and mutilingual type swype just slide for language change . overall , i experience way more grief use swiftkey than swype . and i go back after it could n't predict what i want , learn word be predict only half the time maybe less , could n't add word with number or symbol , and after i look through the insipid look theme . oh i almost forget the capitalization be also horrible most of the time .******2014-12-31******5.1.2.75

5.0******i go back to swiftkey after get frustrate with the primitive prediction ability of google keyboard . the lag i use to experience be go and the keyboard perform superbly . it can predict not just the basic word which all other ordinary keyboard like samsung and google can , but learn your write history and style from your social apps , email etc . so you need to type very few word in their entirety ! fabulous time saver !******2014-12-31******5.1.2.75

4.0******although many language be support , use two different language keyboard by select an icon on the keyboard be n't . with google keyboard , there s an option to change language by select the language button on the on screen keyboard . so w swiftkey , switch from one language to the next be tedious . one must go into setting and change language or select all the language that one need and use both as one keyboard . this can cause issue with autocorrect bc sometimes it confuse language .******2015-05-13******5.2.2.124

5.0******what can i say to add to the plaudit swiftkey keyboard have already richly recieved ? not much . if you text , type note or email from your device , you ll have to go a very long way to find a better app to do the job ! exclude the numerous theme , the prediction and the emojis all of which alone make this app worth it s the little thing that make it worthwhile . i love the fact i can resize the keyboard and that i can have full , thumb or compact style and i can use it dock or undock . the keyboard can be any one of five size . the keyboard can be further customise to show arrow kets , accent character and you can have a number as a row above or a pad on the leave . my type be more precise but if you re a swiper , that be available as be voice input . you can use your cloud account to backup your prediction , set the keyboard feedback and check your usage stats and even check your heatmap . all in all , do n't bother look elsewhere !******2015-05-06******5.2.2.124

3.0******the complete redesign of the app have make it worthless for anything except tap type . the slide flow slide interface have the worst detection of any app i ve ever use , autocorrect be only 60 accurate , you can only correct a mistake flow detection by backspace first , and autocorrect ca n't be automatically apply on flow input . it work if you tap type though , you can even set different appearance for landscape and portrait . i ve use it for month so it s not a learn issue .******2015-03-30******5.2.2.124

4.0******the review tittle say it all . need to rethink access to the arrow key . the current method of add a row at the bottom via setting 1 . take up to much space . 2 . slow and inconvenient to turn on off . the swype keyboard way of do it be superior and very quick to turn on off . perhaps it could be add to the option that pop up on a long press of the 123 key ? the current size position at the bottom would be fine if you could turn it on off quickly . also , now that i think of it , a del key to compliment the bs key would also be nice . seem like enhancement that would make swiftkey just about perfect .******2015-03-14******5.2.2.124

4.0******i have an android phone without the punch through keyboard that i get use to on my old one and this have even the best of three that i have download to try . it do some thing that i be not entirely fond of , but in general . this seem like a solid function application .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124

5.0******be use swiftkey ever since it s be out yes .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
4.0******so . i do all of the play store keyboard and i can clearly say that swiftkey be the best of them . it contain full of optimal configuration size , shape amp . layout . and full emoji keypad . the keyboard itself be very fluid . the only two fault i blame be the lack of beautiful free theme amp . the fact that it add a space between a word and a question mark most minimal axel do not you ? also the fact that after a point it do not put .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
3.0******so , here s the deal . the trial version seem to preform better than the purchase version . the predictive text be leap and bound better , as be the swype . in fact , half the time the swype be so incredibly inaccurate in the purchase version , that it s nearly useless . there have be a few occasion that it bug and predictive text and spell correct cease to work . it s a solid 3 rat . with my complaint out of the way , i can say that it s 1 of the best text apps , aside from the glitch .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
5.0******this be the best keyboard app i ve ever use . the predictive text learn quickly and let you type faster than ever .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
4.0******key be very small letter a little difficult .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
5.0******add more social . network and box for personalization .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124

4.0******prediction be great , and overall speed be very good . if it have 2 extra feature , it d be perfect 1 i know it specialize in learn automatically , but it d be nice to have a user dictionary where you could input your frequently use place name , friend name and email address that be n't in the dictionary . 2 have an option to turn off the auto space after a word prediction . the auto space be particularly annoy when fill out some online form that do n't like extra whitespace .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124
5.0******i like these application be very good .******2015-03-13******5.2.2.124

5.0******if you be someone who like to use a swipe style keyboard then this be the one to use . i ve use swype and the google keyboard and neither compare in term of accuracy and aesthetic . i ve go back to the aforementioned keyboard a few time but have always find myself come back to swiftkey . this be one of those apps that i pay for when it first come out . even though it become free after a few year i be still happy that i have the chance to give them a few dollar for something that i use every single day . if you be not someone who have ever use a swipe keyboard you should give it a try . your touch type be great , but this style of type be incredibly easy to do with just one hand and be great at correct your misclicks . you will be terrible at it until you figure out how to use it , but once you do you will wonder why you ever type with two hand .******2015-03-06******5.2.2.124

1.0******i previously do n't use swiftkey s cloud sync feature but after i activate it i start get autocorrect suggestion for partial or full password . this be a huge problem since i usually use complex password , and these suggestion be no coincidence . this be the main reason i m switch over to other alternative even though swiftkey have serve well in it purpose so far . edit i try enable the cloud function after the update . enable cloud still suggest my password or partial password . this be something you need to address immediately .******2015-03-05******5.2.2.124

2.0******swiftkey understand prediction but insist on auto space for flow , the solution be simple , when flow suggest the current word even after flow be do , when the user pick a word or press space then you suggest the next one . if i m flow it s because you already fail to suggest a word , so let me pick the word . auto space on flow be often a waste of time make the user go back to correct a fail flow interpretation . look at the stock google keyboard , they get flow right and so do swype .******2015-05-14******5.2.3.144

1.0******access the setting be painfully difficult , it s annoy because the tiny button do n't work undock ! when undock if you accidentally hit the empty space right outside the keyboard it will close it down along with the text box you be type and it s content . for example i have to retype this review like 5 time because i keep hit outside the keyboard by accident so now i have to type slowly . this defeat the purpose of have such an intelligent keyboard ! this could be easily solve by cod an area close to the undock keyboard that be not sensitive , and therefore still leave a way for the user to close the keyboard and not have to be so careful about close it by accident every two second . these be issue that the developer should spot themselves not us user , whoever think of the new setting button be n't think at all and have not use it . the emoji page have an ugly theme to it that do n't change with the choice of theme you pick , and this seem as lazy design . it also have a black heart to represent the red heart emoji , why ? other than that this the best keyboard for android . specially with the thumb layout which set it apart with tablet user .******2015-06-02******5.3.0.124

4.0******most function text prediction , customization , emoji support , ect , while well implement , be negligibly better or worse than other third party keyboard . what make swiftkey the best be the cloud storage , include for free , that back up vocabulary and sync seamlessly across device . hard to beat . my only gripe be the lack of innovative design feature , like flesky , which get old after a while . still , i would recommend it to all user seek a stock keyboard replacement .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

3.0******big hand beware , too easy to mistype , if you have small hand you should be ok . word suggestion be terrible , have nice feature like the arrow key but accuracy be horrible even when use swipe .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******i m very picky about my keyboard . while i ll never jump on the swipe to text bandwagon , this keyboard just seem to get it right . trust me and take a few minute to play with the setting to make it your own .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

5.0******the 5 29 15 update have practically address every issue that i ve ever have with swiftkey . i can now safely say that it be best keyboard for android . whether you re a tapper , swiper , or rely on autocorrect . swift key will meet all your need .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
4.0******i ve use , recommend , and love swiftkey for year . buy it before flow even get upgrade . still love it , but i think it lag more now . take a few millisecond to pop up , sometimes even full second . have n't do anything worse than that , though .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******this be the best keyboard by far . love how customisable it be .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******okay . so i have try and test many keyboard . but i always keep come back to swiftkey . the main reason be the ability to key in a ? a , and a ! with the swype of one key . it make life so easy . all other keyboard require a long press to access either one of these character . the beautiful theme nd amaze prediction do n't hurt to have as well .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******be there any way you guy can give us the option to resize the space key ? would be nice .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
3.0******this keyboard use to be amaze but it seem now that it s less accurate than it use to be . sometimes when i manually type out word correctly , swiftkey will change it to a different word , despite the fact that i type it correctly . also , i wish there be an ability to manually add word to swiftkey s dictionary . the swipe function have become much less accurate . it s better than the default keyboard , but not as impressive anymore .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******i find it much easier to use than the default keyboard others i ve try . artificial intelligence at it best !******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
4.0******this have always be an excellent app , worth the price but the swipe to setting feature seem to be harder to access than thr previous method . there should be several option on keyboard sound , to be sure , not just the one . finally , only one new theme seem kind of cheap to me . !******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******my type have become faster and easier than ever . with autocorrection of error , typo , etc , swiftkey free me to type whatever i want to say and trust the program to interpret what i mean to say . it s absolutely fantastic and i recommend it to everyone i meet .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******i see a review below where a user complain that this app be now free when many of us have to pay for it when we get it . i personally post a review month and month ago say exactly that , and i be ignore . yet this person receive a pack worth the 4 . 99 price they pay as compensation . what make their business more valuable than mine ? if you do it for one you should do it for all . you can bet i wo n't support your app again .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******keep go back to swiftkey . auto correction and prediction be unbeatable .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
3.0******this keyboard be perfect , but i do n't see the need to make it so difficult to access setting from the keyboard itself . the long press be easily usable , but now that it s on the very edge , i find it very inconsistent and difficult to use , without hit the predict word .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******the first thing i do when i get a new device be download this keyboard . it have excellent auto correct and learn your word well . i love the layout !******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******this be the best keyboard out there . no other keyboard replacement app give so much for free . i do n't have to download a bunch of plugins to get emojis or foreign language dictionary and letter accent . even have albanian . i love that text predict pull from any language you have download too . smooth and nice ui .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

5.0******the typewriter click be get old , and it always play twice for each key like an echo on my phone for some reason . this be exactly what i ve be want , or at least the option to pick from a set of sound . now i do n't have to keep it on vibrate only for type .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
4.0******great keyboard love use it but sometimes when i use apps such as line it close by itself and take a minute or so to open back up . now i have to use default keyboard .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

4.0******excellent as a whole . like the hub , but the hamburger line can get a little distract while type . can we have the ability to hide them in setting but still have the hub accessible with a swipe from the leave ? also , the keyboard size seem to have change a little bite . there need to be a size between the 3rd 4th option as the 3rd option be too small for me but the 4th seem too big . the emoji keyboard need to be bring into the material world too . or at least it need to be modernise slightly .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

1.0******be you serious ? do you seriously just stamp your logo on the biggest , most visible , most use key of the keyboard ? do you think that s conducive to it function throw in a smatter of your own letter onto a keyboard ? and then to make the stupid thing flash with each press ? what mouth breathe desperation lead to this decision ? how many extra profit dollar do you figure this bone head move would scrape in ? thank be to the software heaven for public repository of previous version of apps .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
4.0******i do an update . now the typewriter sound be go . i hope that will be back . i do n't like the sound there be now on key stroke .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

2.0******new update be laggy and sometimes slow to respond to touch , the new setting pop up be flaky , and the logo on the spacebar be inexplicable and annoy . nice work .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
1.0******i hate it ! font too small ! need to know how to make it larger ! please advise . thank !******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
1.0******love this keyboard until the recent update . the update break it for me . whenever i start to type it just freeze . stock lg keyboard work fine .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
2.0******swiftkey understand prediction but insist on auto space for flow , the solution be simple , when flow suggest the current word even after flow be do , when the user pick a word or press space then you suggest the next one . if i m flow it s because you already fail to suggest a word , so let me pick the word . auto space on flow be often a waste of time make the user go back to correct a fail flow interpretation . look at the stock google keyboard , they get flow right and so do swype .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
3.0******what s the point of have a beta and forum if you wo n't listen to what work and what do n't ? the old hub be perfect where be as a float hub with a long press . maybe it need a nice material theme , but it work . this one be hard to swipe out , and even press . it s unnecessarily slow . it do not look material at all . remind me of the gingerbread day .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
3.0******i could really use a faster way to undo flow mistake because it s not the most accurate . if you accidentally go in the wrong direction , you be force to complete the word then smash the backspace to undo it . also , keyboard shortcut for select all text , undo ing , paste , etc . would really help .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
2.0******from 5 star to 2 because the hub be always load now , make everything slower . when bring our the keyboard there s a white flick of the panel on the leave , every time . it can not be disable .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
5.0******but now by an even bigger margin . thank and keep it up . do n't mess it up now because the new google keyboard be get close to you before you knock out this update .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124
4.0******default keyboard and ca n't use anything else now that i m use to this . it almost always get the word i m try to type perfectly . however , the new menu key placement be not ideal . also , the logo at the bottom of space bar be distract . please revise .******2015-05-29******5.3.0.124

2.0******this be my favorite keyboard . ugh temporarily reduce rat . i ca n't get to the setting quickly anymore . the old long press work great , why change that to a very tiny ui element i ca n't actually use ? be it because of my number bar maybe ? turn on dev show touch . i m hit it , it s just not work . also work if i detach or user compact mode . really miss the long press great .******2015-05-28******5.3.0.124

4.0******prediction be great . it suggest next word base on type history without the need to start type . that make it faster than other keyboard that merely autocorrect the current word . the new hub on the right seem to be a bite feature bloat though . also , a way to customise the type sound would n't go amiss . they do n't sound so great .******2015-05-28******5.3.0.124
3.0******new hub be difficult to get to ! should revert back to the previous method .******2015-05-28******5.3.0.124

5.0******i m totally addict to this app . i cant even bring myself to type anything on my wife s iphone w o get frustrate . i have an idea i think a delete key would be useful , simply because it would allow for the removal of space or deletion of text without have to long press on the text to move the cursor . yes , type be so fast with this app that the long press to move the cursor in order to backspace rather than a simple press of my suggest del button be actually semi annoy .******2015-05-28******5.3.0.124
